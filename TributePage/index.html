					<h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Marie Curie life:</h3>
					<li>
						<strong>1867</strong> - Born in Warsaw, Russian Empire.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1891</strong> - Marie comes to Paris to continue her studies. Where her sister and her husband sheltered her, but six months later, Marie decided to move to the cold attic of the Latin Quarter.  In the same year she entered Sarbonu at the Faculty of Natural Sciences.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1894</strong> - Maria Sklodowska met Pierre Curie at the home of Kowalski's Polish émigrés. They were introduced to Jozef Kowalski, who hoped that Pierre would be able to provide Mary with the opportunity to work in her laboratory.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1895</strong> - Pierre and Maria got married without a wedding.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1903</strong> - Maria presented her doctoral thesis “Investigation of Radioactive Substances” at the Sorbonne, which described the results of intense work in previous years, including the release of new elements - polonium and radium.
						In the same year, 1903, Maria and Pierre Curie were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of the exceptional services that they rendered to science by joint studies of radiation phenomena, discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel."
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1911</strong> - Marie Curie received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for outstanding achievements in the development of chemistry: the discovery of the elements of radium and polonium, the selection of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element." Marie Curie was the first - and today the only woman in the world - twice Nobel Prize winner.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1920</strong> - The French government established a scholarship for Marie Curie, the previous recipient of which was Louis Pasteur.

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					"To my great happiness, for twenty years we have been associated with Madame Curie by a sublime and cloudless friendship. My admiration for her human greatness constantly grew. Her strength of character, purity of thoughts, demanding of herself, objectivity, integrity of judgment - all these qualities are rarely combined in one person. She at any moment felt that she was serving society, and her great modesty did not leave room for narcissism. She was constantly depressed by the sense of cruelty and injustice of society. It was this that gave her the appearance of external rigor, so easily misunderstood by those who were not close to her — strange rigor, not softened by any artificial effort. The most outstanding feat of her whole life - proof of the existence of radioactive elements and their receipt - owes its implementation not only to bold intuition, but also dedication, persistence in performing work with the most incredible difficulties, which is not often found in the history of experimental science."
